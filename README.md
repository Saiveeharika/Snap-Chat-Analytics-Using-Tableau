# Snap Chat Advertisements Analytics Using Tableau
This project explores the impact of political advertising on Snapchat, focusing on how it influences the behaviors and perceptions of everyday users in a highly polarized social media environment. Using Tableau, we analyzed data from Snapchat ad campaigns, including metrics like impressions, click-through rates, engagement, and user demographics. Our findings provide critical insights into how political ads shape user perceptions and behaviors on the platform. These insights are valuable for informing conversations on regulating political ads on social media to protect democratic processes. Ultimately, the project highlights the need for transparency and accountability in digital advertising to ensure fair political discourse.
